### Job Description

As an Applied Data Science, you will take the lead in building novel applications of remote data science via [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft) , ranging from auditing proprietary AI systems in alignment with most recent regulatory calls for auditing artificial intelligence-powered platforms ([1](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13626-Digital-Services-Act-conducting-independent-audits_en), [2](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/artificial-intelligence/guidance-on-ai-and-data-protection/)) to conducting research studies on non-public data. Further, you get the chance to pilot your application directly with relevant organizations and educate the stakeholders on your solution.

Unlike typical Data Scientist roles, where you work with pre-existing libraries - this role gives you the chance to directly contribute on the product side, based on your unique experience and learnings from engaging with various institutions.

### Responsibilities

In this role, you will be responsible for:

- Design and create data science & machine learning use cases for our flagship library
- Collaborate with organizations across the globe to pilot and implement these use-cases, ensuring seamless integration and successful deployment.
- Work closely with stakeholders from product and engineering to iterate on PySyft's core functionality and bring significant improvements to data governance and remote data science experience, based on feedback from pilot partners
- Produce technical documentation to support grassroots adoption of the use cases you develop

### Qualifications

- Bachelor's or Master's degree in a relevant field, such as Computer Science, Data Science, or a related discipline.
- Have 2+ years experience working as a Data Scientist, ML Engineer, or Software Engineer, working on conducting data science projects or training & deploying machine learning models, utilizing Python, common data science tools (Pandas, Numpy, scikit) and/or ML libraries (PyTorch/Tensorflow, JAX)
- Strong technical writing skills
- Excellent communication and advocacy skills to effectively educate and drive the implementation of our pilots with external partners
- Excellent listening and interpersonal skills to understand and address users' specific requirements.

### Not required, but likely a very good fit:

- Knowledge of deploying using Kubernetes (K8s) or Docker/Podman, and willingness to learn more in this space
- Knowledge of privacy-enhancing technologies
- Passion or experience working with AI Safety or language models.
- Contributions to open-source projects
- Strong presentation and public speaking skills
- Familiarity working with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).

### About OpenMined

Over the last 20 years, a handful of AI algorithms have come to directly guide over 12 billion hours a day of people's time, equating roughly to 9.3% of the waking human experience.

Now, frontier AI systems are emerging with the potential to push beyond this 9.3% and enhance or automate intellectual labor around the world with superintelligent capabilities. However, we are largely blind to AI's full effect upon the world because researchers can't sufficiently access AI models or datasets at 1st or 3rd parties.

16,000+ members strong and 6+ years old, OpenMined is a non-profit on a mission to help AI researchers understand and predict AI's impact on society. We do this by building AI governance infrastructure using privacy enhancing technologies that helps researchers access AI systems and datasets â€” to study AI's impact on the world.

We think this external access problem is really really important, and we've started on solving the first step, AI auditing. If you want to help solve this problem and unlock 1000x more data in every scientific field, we'd love to talk to you.
