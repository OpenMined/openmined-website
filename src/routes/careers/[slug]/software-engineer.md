## Job Description

**If you want to democratize access to cutting edge AI, while averting potential harmful impacts on society, OpenMined is the place for you. We're building [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft), an open source software platform for doing just that, and we need you!**

We are looking for a highly talented individual, with hard won industry experience, a track record of exceeding expectations, and who is ready to level up and do the most challenging and rewarding thing in their career so far.

## Mission

Over the last 20 years, a handful of AI algorithms have come to directly guide over 12 billion hours a day of people's time, equating roughly to 9.3% of the waking human experience.

Now, frontier AI systems are emerging with the potential to push beyond this 9.3% and enhance or automate intellectual labor around the world with superintelligent capabilities. However, we are largely blind to AI's full effect upon the world because researchers can't sufficiently access AI models or datasets at 1st or 3rd parties.

16,000+ members strong and 6+ years old, OpenMined is a non-profit on a mission to help AI researchers understand and predict AI's impact on society. We do this by building AI governance infrastructure using privacy enhancing technologies that helps researchers access AI systems and datasets — to study AI's impact on the world.

We think this external access problem is really really important, and we've started on solving the first step, AI auditing. If you want to help solve this problem and unlock 1000x more data in every scientific field, we'd love to talk to you.
