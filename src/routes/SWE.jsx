      <h3 className="text-2xl">About OpenMined</h3>

      <p>
        Led by Andrew Trask (author of Grokking Deep Learning), the team at
        OpenMined is made of a unique blend of PhD candidates, graduates,
        autodidacts and ex-Big Tech / AI startup talent.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        At OpenMined, we are committed to creating a profound and positive
        impact on society by changing the current paradigm of computation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Our flagship Python framework PySyft allows users to perform data
        science on data that is hosted remotely, without obtaining a copy. We
        leverage a combination of open source technologies and cryptographic
        algorithms to provide a way to answer society's most important questions
        while protecting the privacy of individuals.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        OpenMined has a successful track record of executing high-impact
        projects and collaborations that span the globe. We have partnered with
        companies and organizations such as Meta, PyTorch, Twitter, Google,
        Microsoft, LinkedIn, the United Nations and the governments of the
        United States, United Kingdom, France, and New Zealand.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Most recently the UK Frontier AI TaskForce (AI Safety Institute)
        announced their partnership with OpenMined to “develop and deploy
        technical infrastructure that will facilitate AI safety research across
        governments and AI research organisations”.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We are seeking passionate Software Engineers to join our talented team
        of mission driven engineers, data scientists and product designers.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3 className="text-2xl">Your Role</h3>
      <p>
        You are a seasoned engineer with an understanding of data driven
        workflows in distributed systems and containerized applications. Your
        expertise spans various programming paradigms, and you have a rich
        experience in multiple programming languages, web technologies, and data
        science / ML tools. While AI / ML knowledge is a plus, your primary
        focus will be on developing robust libraries, frameworks, and network
        protocols. You have familiarity with the problem domain of scaling
        arbitrary computation beyond a single machine and utilizing a
        combination of cloud, on-prem and virtualization technologies. You
        understand the challenges of maintaining an evolving product with
        backward compatibility and wide platform support.

      <h3 className="text-2xl">OpenMined's Mission</h3>
      <p>
        Over the last 20 years, a handful of AI algorithms have come to directly
        control over 12 billion hours a day of people's time, equating roughly
        to 9.3% of the waking human experience.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Now, frontier AI systems are emerging with the potential to push beyond
        this 9.3% and enhance or automate all intellectual labor around the
        world with super intelligent capabilities. However, we are largely blind
        to AI's true effects upon the world because researchers can't access
        sufficient AI models or datasets at 1st, 2nd, or 3rd parties.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        16,000+ members strong and 6+ years old, OpenMined is a non-profit on a
        mission to help AI researchers understand and predict AI's impact on
        society. By building AI governance infrastructure that helps researchers
        access production AI systems and datasets — to study AI's impact on the
        world.
