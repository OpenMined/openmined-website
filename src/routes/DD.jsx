      <h3 className="text-2xl">Relevant Skills &amp; Career Goals</h3>

      <p>
        The ideal candidate would be capable of and interested in taking a
        hands-on, holistic approach to fundraising in the near term with eyes
        toward the fundraising team growing as resources allow. Additionally,
        despite an increasing headcount of full and part-time staff, OpenMined
        is still principally a volunteer-driven organization, and the lead
        should be open to working with volunteer capacity at all stages of the
        sponsor lifecycle, coordinating tasks and ensuring output quality.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We are a very diverse organization that actively promotes equality,
        inclusion, and diversity. As such, the community contracts with
        full-time, part-time, and volunteer team members from around the world,
        including Asia, Oceania, Africa, Europe, South America, and North
        America. The continent with the largest person-budget holds 28%, the
        smallest 7%, and the median 14%. 58% of our budget funds members in the
        global south. Due to our highly global team, this position will likely
        need to take calls outside of standard working hours from time to time,
        and while the position is fully remote, it is required that the
        candidate work with at least 3 hours of overlap with GMT.

      <h3 className="text-2xl">About OpenMined</h3>

      <p>
        Over the last 20 years, a handful of AI algorithms have come to directly
        guide over 12 billion hours a day of people's time, equating roughly to
        9.3% of the waking human experience.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Now, frontier AI systems are emerging with the potential to push beyond
        this 9.3% and enhance or automate intellectual labor around the world
        with superintelligent capabilities. However, we are largely blind to
        AI's full effect upon the world because researchers can't sufficiently
        access AI models or datasets at 1st or 3rd parties.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        16,000+ members strong and 6+ years old, OpenMined is a non-profit on a
        mission to help AI researchers understand and predict AI's impact on
        society. We do this by building AI governance infrastructure using
        privacy enhancing technologies that helps researchers access AI systems
        and datasets — to study AI's impact on the world.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        We think this external access problem is really really important, and
        we've started on solving the first step, AI auditing. If you want to
        help solve this problem and unlock 1000x more data in every scientific
        field, we'd love to talk to you.
