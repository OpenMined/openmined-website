      <h3 className="text-2xl">Relevant Skills &amp; Career Goals</h3>

      <p>
        The ideal candidate would be capable of and interested in taking a
        hands-on, holistic approach to fundraising in the near term with eyes
        toward the fundraising team growing as resources allow. Additionally,
        despite an increasing headcount of full and part-time staff, OpenMined
        is still principally a volunteer-driven organization, and the lead
        should be open to working with volunteer capacity at all stages of the
        sponsor lifecycle, coordinating tasks and ensuring output quality.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We are a very diverse organization that actively promotes equality,
        inclusion, and diversity. As such, the community contracts with
        full-time, part-time, and volunteer team members from around the world,
        including Asia, Oceania, Africa, Europe, South America, and North
        America. The continent with the largest person-budget holds 28%, the
        smallest 7%, and the median 14%. 58% of our budget funds members in the
        global south. Due to our highly global team, this position will likely
        need to take calls outside of standard working hours from time to time,
        and while the position is fully remote, it is required that the
        candidate work with at least 3 hours of overlap with GMT.

      <h3 className="text-2xl">About OpenMined</h3>

      <p>
        OpenMined is excited to be maturing its fundraising program through the
        appointment of a dedicated Development Lead. Formed in 2017, OpenMined
        is a fully distributed, very diverse open source community of over
        16,000 engineers, researchers, community organizers, product managers,
        project managers, writers, teachers, and enthusiasts actively creating
        open source software, online courses, and impact pilots with strategic
        partners. Our open source software includes industry leading private AI
        tools (such as PySyft, PyDP, TenSEAL, and others). Our course platform
        has enrolled over 12,000 students since launching in 2021, and we have
        several impact projects running within major governments, enterprises,
        and academic labs (most recently including the United Nations Privacy
        Enhancing Technology Lab, ﬁve national statistics oﬃces across Europe
        and North America, Twitter, Microsoft, DailyMotion, and universities
        around the world).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If successful, our software will lead to a 1000x increase in the amount
        of data available across scientiﬁc ﬁelds, public services, and
        industrial applications, driving a decade of breakthroughs across all of
        science and industry. Furthermore, this software will lead to a new
        ecosystem of tools for promoting AI safety and governance, and set the
        standard driving all major enterprises to make their algorithms open for
        external audit. It is outcomes such as these that drive our vision
        statement: a world where every good question is answered.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        This will be accomplished by building software for{' '}
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08347.pdf" target="_blank">
          structured transparency
        </a>
        . Using our software, a scientist in one organization can use data in
        another organization to answer a question, without acquiring a copy of
        the information they're studying. The implications of this breakthrough
        will be signiﬁcant; a researcher in any discipline will be able to
        leverage all relevant data throughout society, as opposed to being
        limited to the data their particular organization has created or
        acquired.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We view this transition as analogous to the birth of a new internet, one
        ﬁlled with non-public information capable of answering some of life's
        most important questions. Our most important mission is to ensure that
        such a vast distributed network of information is stewarded in the
        public interest, avoiding key failure modes such as private monopoly.
        This is a nuanced strategy with implications as to the types and sources
        of funding OpenMined is willing to receive. Aspects of this strategy
        will be discussed during the hiring process.
