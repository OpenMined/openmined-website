        the chance to pilot your application directly with relevant
        organizations and educate the stakeholders on your solution.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Unlike typical Data Scientist roles, where you work with pre-existing
        libraries - this role gives you the chance to directly contribute on the
        product side, based on your unique experience and learnings from
        engaging with various institutions.

      <h3 className="text-2xl">About OpenMined</h3>
      <p>
        Over the last 20 years, a handful of AI algorithms have come to directly
        guide over 12 billion hours a day of people's time, equating roughly to
        9.3% of the waking human experience.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Now, frontier AI systems are emerging with the potential to push beyond
        this 9.3% and enhance or automate intellectual labor around the world
        with superintelligent capabilities. However, we are largely blind to
        AI's full effect upon the world because researchers can't sufficiently
        access AI models or datasets at 1st or 3rd parties.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        16,000+ members strong and 6+ years old, OpenMined is a non-profit on a
        mission to help AI researchers understand and predict AI's impact on
        society. We do this by building AI governance infrastructure using
        privacy enhancing technologies that helps researchers access AI systems
        and datasets â€” to study AI's impact on the world.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        We think this external access problem is really really important, and
        we've started on solving the first step, AI auditing. If you want to
        help solve this problem and unlock 1000x more data in every scientific
        field, we'd love to talk to you.
